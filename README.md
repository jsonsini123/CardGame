This game is my personal interpretation of Blackjack. The main difference between this and the CardGame I made earlier is the graphic which now displays the total points you have and your hand. To play the game you try to get as close to 21 and not over while also making a judgement call whether you want to draw another card or not this is done through a hit (draw a card) or a stand (hold you cards to be compared to a computer). When you finally choose to stand you will be compared to my own basic computer algorithm to see if you won, then a winning/losing/tie message with be created and the graphic altered.
